ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Emily! I'm a visual artist and software development student at Get Building. With a lifelong passion for art and film, 
I love problem-solving and creating new things. Recently, Iâ€™ve developed an interest in coding and aspire to become a full-stack 
developer in the near future. Follow me on GitHub for my most recent projects.

Currently Iâ€™m working on my second get building project. Check it out here! https://emilyamartin.github.io/art-inventory/
