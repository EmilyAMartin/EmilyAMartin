ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emily!
Iâ€™m a visual artist and software development student at Get Coding. Iâ€™ve had a lifelong passion for art, photography and film. 
Since Iâ€™m at my happiest when I can design, problem solve and create i've recently became interested in coding and aspire to 
become a full stack developer in the future. 

Currently Iâ€™m working on my first get coding project. Check it out here! https://emilyamartin.github.io/Side-Scroller-Game-/
